## Objective
The objective of the Onyx Data DNA February 2024 challenge was to analyze a dataset of product ratings and reviews and provide answers to the following questions:
- What is the relationship between product ratings and recommendation status?
- Which brands have the highest average customer satisfaction, and how does it vary across different product categories?
- How do product features influence reviews and ratings?

## Results
- What is the relationship between product ratings and recommendation status?
To address the question regarding the relationship between product ratings and recommendation status, I employed Scatter Plot visuals within my analysis. 
These visuals provide a clear depiction of the correlation between product ratings and recommendation.Through my analysis, I discovered a notable trend: products with higher ratings tend to have a higher recommendation rate. 
This finding aligns with a general consumer behavior phenomenon, where individuals are more inclined to recommend products that they perceive positively, indicating a positive correlation between product ratings and recommendation status.

- Which brands have the highest average customer satisfaction, and how does it vary across different product categories?
To identify brands with the highest average customer satisfaction and understand variations across different product categories, I utilized the ZoomCharts drill-down combo bar pro visual, which provided two distinct insights.
Firstly, the visual showcased the top brands by the highest average rating, allowing for a detailed analysis of customer satisfaction levels. Additionally, it presented the top categories by the highest average rating.
Upon closer examination, it became apparent that while the top brands and categories exhibited slightly lower review counts, the sentiment remained predominantly positive.
This observation suggests that even categories and brands with review counts ranging from 1 to 200 can achieve top ratings, indicating a consistent level of customer satisfaction.

- How do product features influence reviews and ratings?
To examine how product features, such as color or dimensions, influence reviews and ratings, I created two separate tables on the main page of my report.
These tables provide insights into customer ratings, reviews, and recommendations based on color and dimensions, facilitating an easy comparison of the impact of different features. For example, the analysis showed that black was the most reviewed color, comprising 53.13% of all reviews, and it boasted an impressive average rating of 4.27. Additionally, among the 3878 reviews for black products, 2824 individuals recommended them, indicating their popularity and positive ratings. Similarly, the size of products was found to significantly influence reviews and ratings. For instance, products measuring 2.2x1.2x7.3 inches received the highest number of reviews, making up 21.98% of the total, with an average rating of 3.85. Among the 1604 reviews for products of this size, 866 individuals recommended them, reflecting their favorable reception. In contrast, products with dimensions of 11.6x8.5x0.19 inches had the highest average rating of 4.61, based on 507 reviews, with 464 recommendations. This underscores the importance of product dimensions in shaping customer perceptions and preferences.
